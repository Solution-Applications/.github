# Ansys Solution Applications

Welcome to the **Solution Applications** hub!

The **Solution Applications** organization aims to provide Ansys developers with the information and resources needed to develop **solution applications**. This repository is collection of packagesâ€”Ansys flagship products, libraries, shared technologies, and other resourcesâ€”that you can use to develop your own solutions.

To learn where and how to start working in the **Solution Applications** organization, review the sections that follow.

## What is a solution?

Each Ansys flagship product is a simulation tool designed to accurately model physics phenomena in a given domain, such as mechanics, heat transfer, or fluids.

By contrast, a **solution application** (often referred to simply as a "**solution**"), combines multiple products into a single, targeted workflow: with a sequence of steps designed to tackle a very specific multi-domain engineering problem.

A solution application is composed of two parts:

* the **backend**, where the calls to solvers and physics-specific scripts take place and where computational operations occurs

* the **frontend**, a user interface where the user orchestrates the workflow, provides inputs, and collects outputs

## What will you find here?

The Solution Applications organization provides:

* A solution developer's guide that will take your through all important steps of creating and deploying a solution: visit the [Solution Developer's Guide](https://dev-docs.solutions.ansys.com/)

* Templates and examples to initialize your own solution:

  * Check out our solution demonstrator: [Compass Solution](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/compass) ðŸ§­.
  * Check out our solution template for Python-based solutions: [Guided Workflow Template](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/guided-workflow-template).

* Resuable and templated CI/CD pipelines.

* Guided workflow builders (SAF) and reusable components (libraries) which can be consumed from the Ansys-Solutions PyPI server:
  * Check out the [Guided Low Code Workflow](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/glow). 
  * Check out the [Portal](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/portal). 
  * Check out our general-purpose libraries:
    * [Electromagnetics Library](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/electromagnetics-library)
    * [Mechanics Library](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/mechanics-library)
    * [Math-Tools Library](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/math-tools-library)
    * [Session-Setup Library](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/session-setup-library)
    * [Utils Library](https://github.com/Solution-Applications/utils-library)

All the **Solution Applications** python libraries are distributed to be shared accross the solutions thanks to an Ansys internal PyPI server. To get a token to download and use any of those resources from the PyPI server, visit [Ansys-Solutions PyPI server Token](https://dev-docs.solutions.ansys.com).
